## Abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a novel computing architecture for data
management: a distributed, highly dynamic, and heterogeneous environment of
massive scale. Applications for the IoT introduce new challenges for
integrating the concepts of fog and cloud computing as well as sensor networks
in one unified environment. In this paper, we highlight these major challenges
and outline how existing systems handle them. To address these challenges, we
introduce the NebulaStream platform, a general purpose, end-to-end data
management system for the IoT. NebulaStream addresses the heterogeneeity and
distribution of compute and data, supports diverse data and programming models
going beyond relational algebra, deals with potentially unreliable
communication, and enables constant evolution under continuous operation. In
our evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by providing
early results on partial aspects.
