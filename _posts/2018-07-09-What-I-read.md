## [What’s a service mesh? And why do I need one?](https://blog.buoyant.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/)

> tl;dr: A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for making service-to-service communication safe, fast, and reliable. If you’re building a cloud native application, you need a service mesh.

> Connectivity is not enough to implement microservices-based systems on Kubernetes. Application authors want a seamless service experience that includes connectivity and adding coordinates, credentials, and configuration into their applications. To meet this need, the Kubernetes service catalog uses the Open Service Broker application programming interface (API) to connect any application deployed in Kubernetes to a wide variety of service brokers in a microservices-based software enivronment. The Open Service Broker API lets service operators integrate with multiple platforms using a single API specification. As a result of this integration pattern, service users benefit from ease and consistency of use across different types of services from different producers, while service producers benefit from having one integration point that gives them access to multiple platforms. In this session, we'll cover the high-level concepts of the Open Service Broker API and show a glimpse of a beautiful future where Post-it notes, carrier pigeons, and long-distance runners are no longer involved in app configuration.
